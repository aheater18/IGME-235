ARTRIS

The game of Tetris, where the puzzle is your own creativity.

Genre: Puzzle, Sandbox, Creative
Platform: Desktop Only

The theme of this game is player-driven creativity. Given a familiar screen, infinite time, and flexible and easy-to-use tools, what kinds of masterpieces could a player think to create?

Graphics: Retro
Sound: 8-bit/Ambient

The player will be able to select the Tetromino of their choice (as well as be able to choose the color for that piece) with the mouse, and it will be launched into the game screen, where it will slowly fall down to the bottom. The player can press the arrow keys to move that piece to the left or right, make it drop faster, or make it instantly snap to the bottom, and press x and z to turn it clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively. Once the piece has been placed, the player can then select a new piece from the right side of the screen again.

Just like in tetris, once a row is completely filled up, it will disappear. The point of the game, however, is not to make rows disappear. Instead, it is for the player to carefully consider how they must place the pieces in order to make something, whether it's a picture of an 8-bit Italian plumber, a little smiley face, or a custom rendition of the Mona Lisa!

Controls: Keyboard and/or Mouse

If time allows, it would also be interesting to create an online gallery for people to upload their creations for others to see, and even have a simple rating system.

About the Developer:
I'm Andrew Heater, a second year Game Design student at RIT. When I'm not playing games with friends or making them, I'm usually singing in my a capella group. I love learning all sorts of new technologies, and being able to make something I feel proud of.
Right now, I know how to use C#, Java, HTML, CSS, and have dabbled in a few other languages, and I'm learning how to make projects in Maya, Unity, and the Unreal Engine.
